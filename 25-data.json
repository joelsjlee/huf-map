There is a great deal of focus on specific attacks, battles etc.\n\nSecond - domestically - there is coverage of rationing and political infighting over government control of the economy\n\nThere remains the usual coverage of society events, sports etc.",

I added the word \"All\" in the headline \"Hitler's Plan Reported o Kill All Jews.\" The word \"All\" clearly makes a big difference in the meaning, so please be careful when entering in the headline information. I added \"AP\" in the author/byline field. It stands for the Associated Press wire service organization. We actually do have a copy of this article. In the future, if you are able to find us articles we haven't seen before, that would be fantastic. Here is a nifty guide for how to find new material: https://newspapers.ushmm.org/blog/2017/09/14/how-do-i-upload-articles-not-yet-in-the-database/\n\nThank you for your work! -Eric",

    "User Comments": "Through the Google News archives I found this Sarasota Herald-Tribune edition by searching the key word ‚ÄúJews‚Äù. I scrolled through a few pages and found the headline ‚ÄúHitler Regime Wipes Out Jews by Mass Murder‚Äù. This edition was published the day before Thanksgiving 1942. With the holiday season quickly approaching, a quarter of the paper is covered in advertisements for holiday radio shows, Thanksgiving menus, food advertisements, and even a picture of children on Mrs. Claus‚Äô lap appear throughout eight pages. The two main headlines include: ‚ÄúNazis Lose 100,000 Men at Stalingrad‚Äù and a photo with the title ‚ÄúU.S. Warship Rescues Jap Flier‚Äù. These two headlines portray the United States as winning the war against the Axis powers and coincide with the warm feelings that families want to have as they enter the holiday seasons. \nThe majority of the pages that follow the front page are advertisements, cartoons, a listing of social activities, and local news such as a campaign advertisement for city council. As this is a local newspaper published for Sarasota residents, discusses how locals are affected by the war efforts including shortages of oil and milk. \n\tThe headline ‚ÄúNazi Plan for Wiping out Jews to be Outlined‚Äù is found sandwiched between a photo of a baby wearing only a smile and a t-shirt that exposes his bum, followed by a caption bringing humor to the story about a diaper shortage in Memphis, Tennessee and is situated next to a large advertisement posting for a vacuum cleaner, including steps on how to use and maintain the cleaner. Notice how the advertisement is about twice the size of the Nazi plan posting. It is ironic, or extremely purposeful by the hands of the editor, to conceal the article about state officials and President Roosevelt confirming that 2 million Jews have already been slaughtered at the hands of Hitler. In addition, the article informs readers that Dr. Stephen S. Wise, chairman of the World Jewish Congress and president of the American Jewish Congress, has documentation proving that Hitler ordered the extermination of all Jews in Nazi-ruled Europe by the end of 1942 (nearly one month after this publication). Dr. Wise further outlines Hitler‚Äôs plan saying ‚ÄúNazis were moving some four-fifths of the Hews in Hitler-ruled European countries to Poland‚Äù. He also details the method of execution by injections that can kill 100 people each hour. This publication is cut short with more alarming information that the Jewish population in Warsaw had been reduced from 500,000 to an estimated 100,000. One could easily miss this very detailed and horrific article amid all the holiday cheer and light-hearted advertisements. While it is significant to show the loss of 100,000 Nazis in bold, large font on the front page, the sheer number of Jews killed and the further genocides discussed in the Nazi Plan headline overcome the story of the 100,000 Nazis killed. The holiday season is a time of chaos, stress and busyness, but it is also a time of reflection, family time and joy. To go into the season with the thought of Jews being murdered at alarming rates is not enjoyable conversation for the Thanksgiving table. I imagine a family would rather enjoy discussing local solutions to shortages, how to help troops through the holiday season, and the recent Nazi loss at Stalingrad. I understand the editor‚Äôs logic in making the final call on headlines, but wonder if newspaper's focus had been more on the Jewish genocide, if the public would have pushed for more action from the Allied Powers to stop the Holocaust sooner.\n(1942, November 25).

Please note, you're right to point out the article was positioned far from the front page, but its title is actually prominently displayed on p.4: \"State Department Believed to Have Proof of Murders\" is the sub-headline; the main headline is in bigger characters above that : \"U. S. Jewish Group Hears Details of Polish Slaughter Today\" ‚Äì I edited your data for you (the circus elephant photo right next to it is indeed awkward!) \nGood job adding the author, I also added the news service he was working with, mentioned at the beginning of the paragraph: Kenneth L. Dixon (AP). Keep up the great work, we look forward to other interesting finds from you. ‚ÄìNadia",

    "CM Comments": "Again, \"Germans Face Extermination\" is a headline unrelated to your relevant story. However, I can understand why you were confused in this case. Extermination as a phrase here is not quite to be taken literally, although it does refer to deaths on the battlefield. However, the headline for the article about the Holocaust is less strong with the diction. What a fascinating comparison. You are the first person to upload any article from the Tucson Daily Citizen. Good work! -Eric",

Wise went on to say that Nazi doctors were killing ‚Äúmore than 100 men an hour, per doctor.‚Äù The article goes on to say that the Polish government in exile in London reported that Himmler had ordered the extermination of one-half of the Jewish population in Poland by the end of the year and that 250,00 had been killed through September.
