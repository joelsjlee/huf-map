8389,News Article,Freeport Journal-Standard,Freeport ,Illinois,"Tuesday, November 24, 1942",1,Order Half Of Jews In Poland Exterminated,,Sidney J. Williams (UP),Nazi Plan to Kill All Jews Confirmed,Newspapers.com (https://www.newspapers.com),Published,Carlos Gimeno,"Article about ""reports from the Polish underground movement"" on the large scale extermination of Jews in Poland.  This article reports an initial phase of this program comprised of murdering 50% of Polish Jews by the end of 1942, often by SS ""liquidation"" battalions (Einsatzgruppen) [1] and firing squads. The second phase involved ""liquidating"" the remaining Jews later.

This article reports of Jews not killed by the Einsatzgruppen and firing squads being crowded into railroad freight cars, 150 per car with space for 40.  The floors of these cars were reportedly covered with ""a thick layer of chlorate of lime sprinkled with water,"" [2] the cars were sealed tightly, and sometimes they did not depart for up to two days.  Reportedly suffocation claimed the lives of many Jews in these sealed cars and their corpses remained in the cars with the survivors.  Ultimately, the article states, these train cars were brought to ""undisclosed points"" for the killing of the transported Jews.  These ""points"" were likely death camps, such as Auschwitz-Birkenau, where trains of Jews arrived frequently, including 300,000 Polish Jews. [3]

[2] Some research was done, described below, on the possible purposes of lining the floors of the railcars packed with victims with ""chlorate of lime sprinkled with water.""

This research indicates that this chemical preparation would tend to disinfect human excreta, retard the decomposition or corpses, clean the air of fumes associated with such wastes and corpses (benefitting those who were in the direct vicinity as well as those who might be exposed by, for example, opening the door to the rail car upon its arrival at its destination), and serve as a treatment to those overcome by such fumes.  That a material with these properties was used to line the floors of railcars into which victims were loaded implies a great deal about the intentions of those responsible.

Note that the source for this information was published in 1826, before flush toilets were widely in use, which happened in the middle of the 19th century ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flush_toilet ):

""The use of the chlorate of soda, and the chlorate of lime. by Labarraque, A. G.; Translated by: Scott, James, Surgeon; Published in 1826 in London by S. Highley, 174, Fleet Street.""

https://archive.org/stream/b2147400x#page/6/mode/2up

This source explains that chlorate of lime mixed with water can be used to disinfect air, retard the decomposition of corpses, and disinfect toilets including treating urine and fecal matter:

""Reiterated experience has shewn [sic] that the Chlorate of Lime mixed with water has the property of disinfecting the atmosphere, and impeding putrefaction in a sensible manner."" (pages 7-8)

Two uses of chlorate of lime with water mentioned are: ""Disinterment and Inspection of Dead Bodies"" (page 8) and ""Disinfection of Water Closets, Urinary Cisterns, &c."" (page 9)

Described too is how chlorate of lime with water was used in homes to neutralize the ""loathsome effluvium"" of ""Mephitic gas"" escaping from ""emptying places of night soil"" and to prevent this gas from ""penetrating into the Apartments"" of the house. (page 30)  This suggests that chlorate of lime can be used to contain unhealthy fumes emanating from bodily wastes.  For definition of ""night soil"" see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_soil  .

A lengthy case study is presented of the successful treatment of a workman overcome with fumes from a filthy sewer that he was servicing by having him ""respire the concentrated Chlorate."" (pages 32-35)

The author concludes, ""It appears to me very desirable to recommend patients breathe the Chlorate of Soda, and of Lime, in all cases of asphyxia, occasioned by sewers, and privies."" (page 35)

Although the toxicity, if any, of chlorate of lime with water to the people crowded into the railcars has not been addressed here, preceding information suggests that this material was used with a reasonable safety level in the home and as a medication to treat patients.

 I'm on the fence about it: FDR reaffirms his concern for the Jews of Europe, but there's no direct mention about Rabbi Wise's November statement (we only learn that he told reporters the president *authorized him* to say he's shocked…?!). Still, the evidence presented by the committee may be related to a Final solution plan.     

We haven't responded to your question regarding Austria and Germany yet, but within the Anschluss module, we tend to consider out of scope late articles (Fall 1938) that name Germany and not Austria, as they don't consider the Great Reich as a single geographic entity – if that's what you meant. I hope that makes sense, we can discuss it further with Eric.

Hello Kari, thank you for this first batch of submissions from the Helena Independent! Your articles on Kristallnacht and on the Boycott have been approved to the public end of the database. 
Regarding the 3 ""No coverage"" submissions to the Nazi Plan to Kill All Jews"" event module, you entered the year 1938 (November 24-26). The year for this event is actually 1942; I don't see an entry for Nov 24, 1938 in Newspapers.com, so I'm assuming this is just a typo! Can you please confirm? I did some research and didn't find anything either.      
Clipping in Newspapers.com is a bit tricky, I've added the links for you, thank you for submitting  the images.   
I hope you'll have time to pursue research. Eric says we would love to try to coordinate a Sprint with you in the spring; would you reach out to him around mid-November if he hasn't contacted you by then?

Children and orphans were kidnapped and slain. Those who became ill were executed within 2 days. The article states that approximately half of the Jewish population were executed.","Kim Ngan, this is a very interesting piece. It appears that Boake Carter was a British-American news commentator who wrote at the time. I am pretty confident that this piece was syndicated, meaning that a number of newspapers across the country picked it up and put it in their newspaper. I am not sure I've seen it before, though, which makes it pretty noteworthy for our project. Since this piece is a syndicated column, the article type here is better in the category ""editorial or opinion piece"", since Carter is giving his reaction to current news. I changed the article type for you. This piece is from December 1942. Our event module on the Warsaw ghetto focuses on the spring and summer of 1943, as well as any news coverage 1 year after the revolt took place. However, we do have another event module on the first public reports of the Final Solution. Carter mentions in his piece ""Further information tends to indicate that half or about 2,000,000 of the 4,00,000 Jews in Nazi occupied Europe had been massacred in a definite campaign to obliterate the Jew from the face of Europe's continent."" I think that is clear enough for me to approve this under the Nazi Plan to Kill All Jews Confirmed module. I wonder if Carter wrote anything in 1943 on the Warsaw ghetto revolt as it was taking place? It appears that he died in 1944, but could possibly have written something before his death? -Eric",https://newspapers.ushmm.org/article/39623,https://www.newspapers.com/clip/61526947/,Pennsylvania,Uniontown,39.900076,-79.71643259999999

The writer also had an exciting life, as she was a singer in Austria in the 1920s, the subject of photography, and she later became a historian of famous women.

You would definitely assume that the news of a country exterminating 100 men an hour wouldn't be on page three of a paper, nor would you think that such news would have to compete with barber shop advertisements and suggestions on how to conserve time at the community doctor. I feel this article is relevant because it gives an idea as to how little the American people cared about foreign affairs.

Minor local political news (""Laramie to Go Ahead with Manager Government Plans) received a much more prominent headline and location on the front page.","Matt,

It is definitely interesting to see. Of course, it raises the question of whether it is more prominent to be on bottom of the front page or top of the second or third page. Also, though it is at the bottom of the page, the headline is in ALL CAPS. While a specific author is credited, he clearly crafted the article using the AP wire service content (which is also credited). Perhaps that had an impact on placement.

Regardless, thanks for the great find, and thanks for joining us in this research!

8396,News Article,The Brooklyn Daily Eagle/The Brooklyn Eagle,Brooklyn,New York,"Wednesday, November 25, 1942",1,"WORRIED OVER WIFE IN POGROM, LEAPS TO DEATH",,,Nazi Plan to Kill All Jews Confirmed,Newspapers.com (https://www.newspapers.com),Published,Carlos Gimeno,"Note: This article addresses one of History Unfolded's main areas of inquiry: how newspaper coverage influenced what Americans knew about the Holocaust, when they knew it, how they reacted to it, and what impacts this information had.  In the present article these concepts are not abstractions, but for one man concrete matters of life or death.

This article represents the afternoon paper the Brooklyn Eagle's [2] coverage of Dr. Stephen Wise's November 24, 1942 press conference [1] on the Nazi plan to exterminate the Jews (the November 24, 25, 26, and 27 papers were checked).  There was coverage related to the extermination of Jews in Europe on two of these days,[3][4] but no coverage of Dr. Wise's press conference other than the present article.

The present article reports that earlier on the day it was published, Wednesday, November 25, 1942, 60-year-old Jewish furrier Volco Zissman committed suicide by, it was believed, jumping from his former 15th-floor apartment.  His body was found ""in front of Standish Hall, 45 W. 81st St., Manhattan.""

It goes on to explain that when Zissman came to the U.S. ""he had to leave his wife in France.""  It further explains that on a dresser in Zissman's former apartment, from which he plunged, were found a note written in French ""and a newspaper opened to a statement of Rabbi Stephen S. Wise"" that the killing of all occupied Europe's Jews had been ordered by Hitler.

The article leaves it to the reader to put together these facts and come to the conclusion that Zissman may have committed suicide due to feelings about his wife remaining in France to possibly perish under Hitler's mass murder order reported in the newspaper left open on the dresser.

This article is a remarkable example of the impact that newspaper coverage can have on people in general and specifically the impact coverage of Rabbi Wise's press conference on the Holocaust seems to have had on Mr. Zissman.

What article could have triggered Mr. Zissman's suicide?  We know that it had to be somewhere inside the newspaper since the present article says that the newspaper containing the article was ""opened,"" which would have been unnecessary if the article were on the front or back page.

The New York Times, believed to be a morning newspaper that Mr. Zissman would have had access to in Manhattan, had an article on Rabbi Wise's press conference, published on November 25, 1942, that mentioned Hitler's ""extermination campaign"" on ""Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe.""[5]  This New York Times article was on page 10, inside the paper, so it is a candidate for the article that may have triggered Mr. Zissman's suicide.  Perhaps amplifying the shock of this first New York Times article were two other related articles also on page 10. [6][7]

It seems unlikely that the Brooklyn Eagle could be the source of the suicide-triggering article.  This is because this newspaper did not publish any articles about Dr. Wise's speech except the present one (see above).  Note that [3] does not mention Wise and was published on the front page, making it a poor candidate for the article that spurred Mr. Zissman to suicide.

Of course other articles including those in morning newspapers published on November 25th and in afternoon papers published on November 24th with the correct coverage published inside the paper are candidates too.

Due to the present article's historical significance, the associated comments below are somewhat lengthy as this article contains much to annotate.

This article reports on information about atrocities against Jews in Europe by Nazi Germany told by sources to Dr. Stephen S. Wise, World Jewish Congress chairman and American Jewish Congress president, and confirmed ""as authentic by the"" State Department.  The article states that Dr. Wise had a ""press conference shortly after he had conferred with State Department officials.""

----------Research Into the Accuracy of Dr. Wise's Information----------

One piece of information communicated to Dr. Wise was that about 2,000,000/4,000,000 Jews in the parts of Europe occupied by the Nazis had been killed.  Another two pieces of information were that (A) in 1942 Hitler ordered the extermination of all of the Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe and (B) that the Nazis were processing the bodies of deceased civilians into ""such war-vital commodities as soap, fats, and fertilizer.""

In regards to the information of (A) above, Hitler authorized the extermination of the Jews in 1941 but the January 20, 1942 Wansee Conference was where the implementation of this plan was discussed [0], so Dr. Wise received reasonably accurate information about Hitler's orders to exterminate the Jews and their implementation.

As to the information of (B), processing of human corpses by Nazis into soap, fats, and fertilizer, the first (soap) seems to have only occurred on a small scale despite rumors to the contrary [1] while there are numerous reports of concentration camp crematorium ashes and/or bones being used for fertilizer, for example in Majdanek [2][5], Birkenau [3], Dachau [7], Neuengamme [5],  Janowska [6], Buchenwald [4][7], and to hide the evidence of crimes [8].

Accordingly, the information Dr. Wise received about the soap production from human corpses seems to be based on rumors circulating at the time and greatly exaggerated while the information on processing of bodies of civilians into fertilizer seems to have significant accuracy.

----------Nazi Reaction----------

The news reported in the present article was published in at least two New York Times articles on November 25, 1942 [10] and November 26, 1942 [11].  In [11] appears a statement that documents from the State Department contained affidavits attributed to ""reliable persons who knew"" of atrocities including producing soap (and also lubricants and fats) from Jewish corpses.

(As a research note, if it hasn't been already done, it would be interesting to find the State Department documents mentioned above to see what the sources of the different pieces of information were and if they add anything to the historical record.)

According to Wikipedia, the news contained in these New York Times reports reached Heinrich Himmler, Reich Leader of the SS and the ""key and senior Nazi official responsible for conceiving and overseeing implementation of the so-called Final Solution, the Nazi plan to murder the Jews of Europe."" [13]

In response to this news, Himmler on November 30, 1942 wrote a letter to Heinrich Muller, chief of the Gestapo and one of the planners and executors of the Holocaust, [14] which reportedly said in part,

""You have guaranteed me that at every site the corpses of these deceased Jews are either burned or buried, and that at no site anything else can happen with the corpses""

Elsewhere in the letter Himmler asks Muller to investigate if ""misuse"" of this policy had occurred, ""misuse"" that can be interpreted to possibly refer to Wise's allegations of soap, lubricant and fat making from Jewish corpses. [15]

This letter has been interpreted to support the notion that in order to enhance the secrecy of the murders of Jews in death camps there was no widespread and industrial production of soap, lubricants, and fats from Jewish corpses.

There is a reported discrepancy in this letter that should be addressed.  The letter refers to Wise's point of view as of September, 1942, a time before he had spoken publicly of these issues.  This discrepancy has been explained as either a mistake in the letter or due to an intelligence interception in September, 1942 of the information that was ultimately communicated to Dr. Wise.  The latter is a viable possibility because the Nazis had cracked a diplomatic code in Switzerland, the source of this information. [15]

Additionally, two items from the USHMM collections relevant to this issue are:

A) (Accession Number: 1994.55.6)https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/irn8728
This first item is a bar of soap ""issued to Edmund Graf while imprisoned at Flossenburg.""  The description of this item goes on to state that ""he was told that it had been made from the 'remains of Jewish victims,' but this rumor was not true.""  Note that this soap is stamped ""RIF""

B) (Photograph #48966) https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/pa1168095
This second item is a photo captioned, ""Jewish men in the Hallen displaced persons camp bury bars of soap believed to be made from human fat.""  The original caption written in Yiddish says, ""Bringing for burial the remains of our martyrs--several boxes of RIF soap -- (pure Jewish fat).""  Note that the bar of soap of A) is ""RIF"" soap also.

A Wikipedia article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_made_from_human_corpses) explains the significance of the ""RIF"" stamp on German soap and starts by mentioning that in Germany during the War there was a fat shortage.  Briefly, this article explains that ""RIF"" means ""National Center for Industrial Fat Provisioning"" and not ""State Jewish Fat,"" the latter which would have the acronym ""RJF"" and could be confused with ""RIF"" due to fonts used at the time.  That ""RIF"" soap was made from Jewish fat was a rumor used to terrify Jews and others to coerce compliance with the Nazi regime [9] but generally accepted to be false.  Items A) and B) above provide examples of how this rumor was spread in concentration camps and its penetration and acceptance at the time.

C) A third item worth mentioning is ""Sam Waagenaar articles"" ( https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/irn514209 ) Accession Number: 1993.A.0098, including one article about "" his experiences with what he believed to be a human soap factory.""  It would be interesting to see if this article refers to Dr. Spanners lab in Danzig, Poland or the soap production facility at the Jasenovac concentration camp or a third less well known facility where production of soap from human corpses may have occurred ([1] above for more information on Dr. Spanner and Jasenovac).

It goes on to explain that he had documentation that proved that this was the plan and that approximately half of the estimated 4 million Jews in Nazi occupied Europe had already been killed and the Nazis planned to move the rest off to Poland in order to complete their goal. Wise went on to say that Nazi doctors were killing “more than 100 men an hour, per doctor.” The article goes on to say that the Polish government in exile in London reported that Himmler had ordered the extermination of one-half of the Jewish population in Poland by the end of the year and that 250,00 had been killed through September.

4654,News Article,Sarasota Herald-Tribune,Sarasota,Florida,"Wednesday, November 25, 1942",5,Nazi Plan For Wiping Out Jews To Be Outlined,,AP,Nazi Plan to Kill All Jews Confirmed,Google Newspaper Archive (https://news.google.com/newspapers),Published,kflipscomb .,"Through the Google News archives I found this Sarasota Herald-Tribune edition by searching the key word “Jews”. I scrolled through a few pages and found the headline “Hitler Regime Wipes Out Jews by Mass Murder”. This edition was published the day before Thanksgiving 1942. With the holiday season quickly approaching, a quarter of the paper is covered in advertisements for holiday radio shows, Thanksgiving menus, food advertisements, and even a picture of children on Mrs. Claus’ lap appear throughout eight pages. The two main headlines include: “Nazis Lose 100,000 Men at Stalingrad” and a photo with the title “U.S. Warship Rescues Jap Flier”. These two headlines portray the United States as winning the war against the Axis powers and coincide with the warm feelings that families want to have as they enter the holiday seasons. 
The majority of the pages that follow the front page are advertisements, cartoons, a listing of social activities, and local news such as a campaign advertisement for city council. As this is a local newspaper published for Sarasota residents, discusses how locals are affected by the war efforts including shortages of oil and milk. 
	The headline “Nazi Plan for Wiping out Jews to be Outlined” is found sandwiched between a photo of a baby wearing only a smile and a t-shirt that exposes his bum, followed by a caption bringing humor to the story about a diaper shortage in Memphis, Tennessee and is situated next to a large advertisement posting for a vacuum cleaner, including steps on how to use and maintain the cleaner. Notice how the advertisement is about twice the size of the Nazi plan posting. It is ironic, or extremely purposeful by the hands of the editor, to conceal the article about state officials and President Roosevelt confirming that 2 million Jews have already been slaughtered at the hands of Hitler. In addition, the article informs readers that Dr. Stephen S. Wise, chairman of the World Jewish Congress and president of the American Jewish Congress, has documentation proving that Hitler ordered the extermination of all Jews in Nazi-ruled Europe by the end of 1942 (nearly one month after this publication). Dr. Wise further outlines Hitler’s plan saying “Nazis were moving some four-fifths of the Hews in Hitler-ruled European countries to Poland”. He also details the method of execution by injections that can kill 100 people each hour. This publication is cut short with more alarming information that the Jewish population in Warsaw had been reduced from 500,000 to an estimated 100,000. One could easily miss this very detailed and horrific article amid all the holiday cheer and light-hearted advertisements. While it is significant to show the loss of 100,000 Nazis in bold, large font on the front page, the sheer number of Jews killed and the further genocides discussed in the Nazi Plan headline overcome the story of the 100,000 Nazis killed. The holiday season is a time of chaos, stress and busyness, but it is also a time of reflection, family time and joy. To go into the season with the thought of Jews being murdered at alarming rates is not enjoyable conversation for the Thanksgiving table. I imagine a family would rather enjoy discussing local solutions to shortages, how to help troops through the holiday season, and the recent Nazi loss at Stalingrad. I understand the editor’s logic in making the final call on headlines, but wonder if newspaper's focus had been more on the Jewish genocide, if the public would have pushed for more action from the Allied Powers to stop the Holocaust sooner.
