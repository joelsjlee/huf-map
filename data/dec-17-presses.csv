It’s a bit tricky, but considering the date and the content, it’s a better fit for our “Allies Denounce” event, rather than “Nazi Plan to Kill All Jews Confirmed”, although I see why you selected that module. You can read a description here: https://newspapers.ushmm.org/events/allies-denounce-nazi-plan-to-exterminate-the-jews. 
You make a good point about the page where the piece is featured; I’d say page 4 is actually not that bad as this is the editorial page, so I think it means the paper actually picked these specific news to comment on. I changed your Article Type from News Article to Editorial/Opinion Piece, again due to the placement on this page, under the paper’s information, even though the tone is pretty neutral.

This is a really good find.

Good find. Thanks for sharing it with us.  Be careful when using Newspapers.com to always look at the page number on the newspaper scan itself. Do not rely simply on what Newspapers.com interface says. This article, for example, was on page 11, not page 25.

1.) I am not certain this is an editorial, but it didn't appear to be reporting on the Allied Denunciation of the Holocaust, it appeared to expect the reader to know that before reading, so i included it as an editorial instead of a News Article.

2.)

December 17, 1942
United Nations Condemn Nazi Slaying of Jews
11 Allies Pledge Punishment of Those Responsible
WASHINGTON, Dec. 17 - (UP) - Eleven of the United Nations and the French National Committee today condemned German’s [sic] “bestial policy” of mass slaughters of Jews and resolved that those responsible would not escape retribution.
The statement was endorsed by the Belgian, Czechoslovak, Greek, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norwegian, Polish, Soviet, United Kingdom, United States and Yugoslav governments and the Fighting French. Other United Nations are expected to subscribe to it later.
The denunciation supplemented a previous pledge by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill to punish Axis officials guilty of killing hostages and other offenses.
The statement of Jewish oppression accused Germany of “carrying into effect Hitler’s oft-repeated intention to exterminate the Jewish people in Europe.” It charged that Jews were being transported from occupied countries “in conditions of appalling horror and brutality;” that Polish ghettos are being “sys-

tematically emptied;” that the able-bodied are being worked to death in labor camps, and that the inform [sic] are left to die or are massacred.
The text of the statement, made public here and in London:
“The attention of the Belgian, Czechoslovak, Greek, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norwegian, Polish, Soviet, United Kingdom, United States and Yugoslav governments and the French National Committee has been drawn to numerous reports from Europe that the German authorities, not content with denying to persons of Jewish race in all the territories over which their barbarous rule has been extended, the most elementary human rights, are now carrying into effect Hitler’s oft-repeated intention to exterminate the Jewish people in Europe.
Many Are Transported
“From all the occupied countries Jews are being transported in conditions of appalling horror and brutality to Eastern Europe.
“In Poland, which has been made the principal Nazi slaughter house, the ghettos established by the invader are being systematically emptied of all Jews except for a few highly-skilled workers required for war industries. None of those taken away are ever heard of again.
“The ablebodied are slowly worked to death in labor camps. The inform [sic] are left to die of exposure and starvation or are deliberately massacred in mass executions. The number of victims of these bloody cruelties is reckoned in many hundreds of thousands of entirely innocent men, women and children.
“The above mentioned governments and the French National Committee condemn in the strongest possible terms this bestial policy of cold-blooded extermination. They declare that such events can only strengthen the resolve of all freedom loving people to overthrow the barbarous Hitlerite tyranny. They re-affirm their solemn resolution to ensure that those responsible for these crimes shall not escape retribution and to press on with the necessary practical measures to this end.”",https://newspapers.ushmm.org/article/21195,https://newspapers.ushmm.org/manager/article/photo/16885/original,New+York,Staten+Island,40.5795317,-74.1502007,None

4655,News Article,St. Petersburg Times,St. Petersburg,Florida,"Sunday, December 20, 1942",10,Hitler Regime Wipes Out Jews By Mass Murder,,AP,Allies Denounce Nazi Plan to “Exterminate” the Jews,Google Newspaper Archive (https://news.google.com/newspapers),Published,kflipscomb .,"This 66 page Sunday edition of the St. Petersburg Times reflects the time of its publication: Christmas 1942. Christmas advertisements flood these pages announcing sales for: clothing, furniture, and fruit baskets at nearby department stores- perfect gifts for your loved ones. Approximately 27 of the 66 pages (40 percent) are filled with cartoons, wedding announcements, classifieds and other assortments of light heartedness. The main headline is attention grabbing, stating in capital letters “REDS LAUNCH NEW DRIVE” followed by “Allies shatter Jap Line; Enemy Cruiser is Sunk”. The overall tone of this edition is hope set in reality. It does not stray from the difficulties of war, such as its mention of food rations, and the need for 59 draftees, but it counteracts these realities by showing local acts of heroism, and courage. One such example is the story of Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker, who survived 21 days in an open boat in the Pacific and has his picture featured prominently in the paper. Rickenbacker tries to down play the hardship of rationing food compared to being stranded in the Pacific.
	The byline entitled “Hitler Regime Wipes Out Jews by Mass Murder” is found on page 10 of 66.  It is found on the top of the page, mid-center, under a page entitled National News. To the left of the article is a byline describing the death of a character from a New Jersey murder trial, and on the right hand side is a photo showing the Army taking over a junkyard in South Carolina. A large advertisment is found on this page selling “practical gifts” for Christmas including many household items. This article is different in its layout, it breaks down Hitler’s impact on the Jews country by country, mentioning: Poland, Yugo-Slavia, Czecho-Slovakia, France, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Norway. This breakdown shows the Hitler Regime’s sphere of influence and the imprisonment, ghetto formations and annihilation of European Jews. The article has a heavy emphasis on country geography and the cities impacted. Depending on the reader’s prior knowledge, this may be a stumbling block in the reader’s understanding of the article’s depth. However, this article also uses statistics to underscore the relevance and importance of realizing how Hitler’s Regime has changed Europe. The article quotes Dr. Stephen S. Wise, president of the American Jewish Congress, stating that “since 1932 2,000,000 Jews in Europe have been deported or have perished, and ‘another 5,000,000 are in danger of extermination”. These parcels of information from Dr. Wise were also reported in the November 25, 1942 edition of the Sarasota-Herald Tribune. 
	As Dr. Wise’s findings were found in two Florida papers published within one month in of each other, I decided to explore this connection, and see if other papers published Dr. Wise’s statistics. After using Google to search parts of the quote “since 1939 2,000,000 Jews in Europe have been deported or have perished…” I found that five national papers published Dr. Wise’s findings, including papers in: Ohio, Kansas, California and Arizona. After no success finding these publications (on microfilm) in better known newspapers such as The New York Times and Wall Street Journal, I used Google again to search for: “Hitler Regime Wipes Out Jews by Mass Murder” Sarasota Herald-Tribune. The first link led me to the History Unfolded website, which is part of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. From there, I found that on November 24, 1942, Dr. Wise held a press conference to discuss his findings of the genocide of Jews, and persuaded President Roosevelt to take action against these annihilations. From this press conference, the Polish government sent a report two weeks later entitled “The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied Poland” to the government leaders of the Allied Forces. The publication of this St Petersburg Times article correlates with the time that the Allied governments, who were part of the United Nations, denounced the Nazi’s plan of mass extermination, which took place on December 17, 1942 (Nazi Plan to Kill All Jews Confirmed). 
	I found this article through the Google News archive with the keyword “Jews”; I did not know the significance of this date and its correlations with Dr. Wise’s press conference. It is interesting that lesser known newspapers such as The Times Recorder from Zanesville Ohio published about it while a larger circulation audience such as The New York Times did not. So from 1942-1945, Allied governments and citizens knew about Hitler’s plan and while The Allies did eventually defeat the Nazi Regime, to what length and what expenses did the Allies go to make sure no more Jews die? They knew how, they knew where, and they knew approximately how many- did they just seemingly allowed it to happen? Millions could have been saved if the Allies came together and made a plan to combat this genocide, I am not inferring it would be easy, but I am implying that the Allies knew Jews were being murdered and they did not do enough to stop it.

History Unfolded/Article Summary

Topic: “Allies Denounce Nazi Plan to “Exterminate” the Jews”


	My partner and I went to the Akron-Summit County Public Library in downtown Akron, Ohio, to study our topic, “Allies Denounce Nazi Plan to “Exterminate” the Jews”.  We were taken to the third floor Special Collections area, where the microfilm and microfilm machines were located.  We located the December 1942 microfilm as instructed on the website.  We were given one of the newer microfilm machines, where you could zoom in and crop out the images better.  We went to the front page of the Thursday, December 17, 1942 Akron Beacon Journal News microfilm and almost instantly found our article.  It was a small, three paragraph article titled, 11 Allies Pledge Revenge for Jews.  After printing it out, we continued through the month finding nothing more.

Our article stated:	  

A conference of eleven allied nations including the French national committee condemned the Nazi plan to exterminate the Jews and promised retribution.  Some of the nations included but were not limited to Belgium, Poland, the United States of America, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.  While only 12 countries signed the pledge, more were expected to sign on.  This pledge was added to an earlier pledge by Prime Minister Winston  Churchill and President Franklin Roosevelt, which stated that they would punish individuals guilty of killing hostages among other offenses.",,https://newspapers.ushmm.org/article/4203,https://newspapers.ushmm.org/manager/article/photo/3989/original,Ohio,Akron,41.0814447,-81.51900529999999,None

Moreover, the Allies had specific indications that Poland was a ""slaughter house""  of Jews from ghettoes. This article challenges my assumption that the Allies were relatively oblivious of the specific atrocities of the Holocaust. I also wonder based on the reading of this article what the Allies did in their pledge that those responsible ""shall not escape retribution."" If the Allies were slow to act, that would be an uncomfortable realization for me.
