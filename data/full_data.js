It\u2019s actually from the Gettysburg Compiler, not the Gettysburg Times, and you\u2019re the first user to find an article in this Pennsylvania newspaper! I embedded the Newspapers.com link for you so that future scholars and researchers can have a better access to the article online; this also allows to display a thumbnail preview of the article on the public end of the History Unfolded website. Quick note on your headline: make sure you enter it as you see it on the page, so here, with quotes around 'Horror'; it doesn't look like much, but it makes a difference from an editorial point of view and readership perception.

They're indeed a bit tricky and I actually edited another of your finds that was a better fit for the Allies Denounce module, rather than Nazi Plan to Kill All Jews. \nSee https://newspapers.ushmm.org/events/nazi-plan-to-kill-all-jews-confirmed\nand https://newspapers.ushmm.org/events/allies-denounce-nazi-plan-to-exterminate-the-jews\nLet us know if you have questions.

It was published a bit too late for our \"Nazi Plan to Kill All Jews Confirmed\" event module, which focuses on late November and December 1942. However, since it mentions both \"Hitler's plan to exterminate Europe's Jews\" and Rabbi Wise (and it's not so long after December 1942!), it makes for a great new addition to the database.  \nFor future reference, please make sure to check the scope and dates guideline of our events at https://newspapers.ushmm.org/events/events-all?from=global-nav.

                "User Comments": "Article about \"reports from the Polish underground movement\" on the large scale extermination of Jews in Poland.  This article reports an initial phase of this program comprised of murdering 50% of Polish Jews by the end of 1942, often by SS \"liquidation\" battalions (Einsatzgruppen) [1] and firing squads. The second phase involved \"liquidating\" the remaining Jews later.\n\nThis article reports of Jews not killed by the Einsatzgruppen and firing squads being crowded into railroad freight cars, 150 per car with space for 40.  The floors of these cars were reportedly covered with \"a thick layer of chlorate of lime sprinkled with water,\" [2] the cars were sealed tightly, and sometimes they did not depart for up to two days.  Reportedly suffocation claimed the lives of many Jews in these sealed cars and their corpses remained in the cars with the survivors.  Ultimately, the article states, these train cars were brought to \"undisclosed points\" for the killing of the transported Jews.  These \"points\" were likely death camps, such as Auschwitz-Birkenau, where trains of Jews arrived frequently, including 300,000 Polish Jews.

That a material with these properties was used to line the floors of railcars into which victims were loaded implies a great deal about the intentions of those responsible.\n\nNote that the source for this information was published in 1826, before flush toilets were widely in use, which happened in the middle of the 19th century ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flush_toilet ):\n\n\"The use of the chlorate of soda, and the chlorate of lime. by Labarraque, A. G.; Translated by: Scott, James, Surgeon; Published in 1826 in London by S. Highley, 174, Fleet Street.\"\n\nhttps://archive.org/stream/b2147400x#page/6/mode/2up\n\nThis source explains that chlorate of lime mixed with water can be used to disinfect air, retard the decomposition of corpses, and disinfect toilets including treating urine and fecal matter:\n\n\"Reiterated experience has shewn [sic] that the Chlorate of Lime mixed with water has the property of disinfecting the atmosphere, and impeding putrefaction in a sensible manner.\" (pages 7-8)\n\nTwo uses of chlorate of lime with water mentioned are: \"Disinterment and Inspection of Dead Bodies\" (page 8) and \"Disinfection of Water Closets, Urinary Cisterns, &c.\" (page 9)\n\nDescribed too is how chlorate of lime with water was used in homes to neutralize the \"loathsome effluvium\" of \"Mephitic gas\" escaping from \"emptying places of night soil\" and to prevent this gas from \"penetrating into the Apartments\" of the house. (page 30)  This suggests that chlorate of lime can be used to contain unhealthy fumes emanating from bodily wastes.  For definition of \"night soil\" see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_soil  .\n\nA lengthy case study is presented of the successful treatment of a workman overcome with fumes from a filthy sewer that he was servicing by having him \"respire the concentrated Chlorate.\" (pages 32-35)\n\nThe author concludes, \"It appears to me very desirable to recommend patients breathe the Chlorate of Soda, and of Lime, in all cases of asphyxia, occasioned by sewers, and privies.\" (page 35)\n\nAlthough the toxicity, if any, of chlorate of lime with water to the people crowded into the railcars has not been addressed here, preceding information suggests that this material was used with a reasonable safety level in the home and as a medication to treat patients.\n\n[3] AUSCHWITZ:  https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005189",

This one is actually another good fit for our \u201cNazi Plan\u201d event module. While it doesn\u2019t focus on Rabbi Wise\u2019s statement, it was published around the same time and is explicit about the Nazis undertaking to annihilate the Jews. Therefore, I recategorized this entry under our content module, rather than Other Noteworthy Findings. Great work, Katelynn! \u2013Nadia",

The population of Idaho in 1942 wasnt even half a million.  The number is even smaller for those who actually were able to pick up the newspaper and read it.  The fact this article went into such specifics for a comparably small audience is very fascinating.",
                "CM Comments": "Hello Micah, thank you for your contribution to History Unfolded, you found great articles! Here it looks like you merged two articles in one: \"Nazi Grip on Stalingrad Weakens Under Crushing Russian Drive\" (last column) and \"Hitler Marks Jews For Death\" are two different stories. Only the latter is relevant to the collection in general and to our \"Nazi Plan To Kill All Jews Confirmed\" event module in particular. It's a bit tricky but you can determine that by looking at the horizontal lines that separate each piece. \nIt turns out we already have this article in the database, but maybe you didn't see that because of that confusion. In general, remember to check the database at https://newspapers.ushmm.org/search/ before submitting. Let us know if you have questions. I'll send some more feedback separately.

I edited your publication date field, as this issue is from December 4 rather than November 24, 1942.  \nInterestingly, based on the two short lines under it, it looks like that main\"Hitler Order\" headline is linked to the two articles below, so not just the \"Jewish Air Corps Formation\". I added the sub-headline \"Nazis Murder 1,500,000 in Europe\" to your User Comments field to indicate that. \nThree of your four submissions have been approved, I'm sending you more feedback regarding the fourth one separately.

Maybe you meant to upload the article next to it, \"Nazis Accused Of Planning To Kill Jews\". We actually have it in the collection though, which means someone else already submitted it.

Still, the evidence presented by the committee may be related to a Final solution plan.     \n\nWe haven't responded to your question regarding Austria and Germany yet, but within the Anschluss module, we tend to consider out of scope late articles (Fall 1938) that name Germany and not Austria, as they don't consider the Great Reich as a single geographic entity \u2013 if that's what you meant. I hope that makes sense, we can discuss it further with Eric.    \nIt's great you got your shots! Stay safe \u2013Nadia",

Your articles on Kristallnacht and on the Boycott have been approved to the public end of the database. \nRegarding the 3 \"No coverage\" submissions to the Nazi Plan to Kill All Jews\" event module, you entered the year 1938 (November 24-26). The year for this event is actually 1942; I don't see an entry for Nov 24, 1938 in Newspapers.com, so I'm assuming this is just a typo! Can you please confirm? I did some research and didn't find anything either.      \nClipping in Newspapers.com is a bit tricky, I've added the links for you, thank you for submitting  the images.   \nI hope you'll have time to pursue research. Eric says we would love to try to coordinate a Sprint with you in the spring; would you reach out to him around mid-November if he hasn't contacted you by then? Thank you! \u2013Nadia",

There is a great deal of focus on specific attacks, battles etc.\n\nSecond - domestically - there is coverage of rationing and political infighting over government control of the economy\n\nThere remains the usual coverage of society events, sports etc.",

Children and orphans were kidnapped and slain. Those who became ill were executed within 2 days. The article states that approximately half of the Jewish population were executed.",
                "CM Comments": "Kim Ngan, this is a very interesting piece. It appears that Boake Carter was a British-American news commentator who wrote at the time. I am pretty confident that this piece was syndicated, meaning that a number of newspapers across the country picked it up and put it in their newspaper. I am not sure I've seen it before, though, which makes it pretty noteworthy for our project. Since this piece is a syndicated column, the article type here is better in the category \"editorial or opinion piece\", since Carter is giving his reaction to current news. I changed the article type for you. This piece is from December 1942. Our event module on the Warsaw ghetto focuses on the spring and summer of 1943, as well as any news coverage 1 year after the revolt took place. However, we do have another event module on the first public reports of the Final Solution. Carter mentions in his piece \"Further information tends to indicate that half or about 2,000,000 of the 4,00,000 Jews in Nazi occupied Europe had been massacred in a definite campaign to obliterate the Jew from the face of Europe's continent.\" I think that is clear enough for me to approve this under the Nazi Plan to Kill All Jews Confirmed module. I wonder if Carter wrote anything in 1943 on the Warsaw ghetto revolt as it was taking place? It appears that he died in 1944, but could possibly have written something before his death? -Eric",

The writer, Dorothy Moulton Mayer, was extremely well-informed about the atrocities happening in Europe and sounded passionate throughout her letter. The writer also had an exciting life, as she was a singer in Austria in the 1920s, the subject of photography, and she later became a historian of famous women. I found this piece intriguing, and I hope you do too.",

The writer seems to not have a deep or accurate understanding of the fact that many Jews tried (and failed) to come to the US before this time, due in part to US immigration law restrictions/hurdles. There is a follow-up piece in the same paper (https://newspapers.ushmm.org/article/20441) that you should read if you haven't already. The writer (perhaps the same one) makes similar arguments. We did not have this piece that you just submitted, though. It is a great addition to the database! I was also able to include the newspapers.com clipping you did in the entry, so others can read this easier in the future. Thank you for your work! -Eric",

That piece has a mention of Admiral Darlan's pledge to help stop the persecution of Jews. The reference is too broad for us to include as news coverage on the confirmation of the Final Solution, but one does wonder whether Admiral Darlan made the pledge based in the news about the Final Solution. I think it is reasonable that he did. I also approved your other two submissions as \"no coverage\" findings. Good work! -Eric",

However, this article is on page 4 of the newspaper and reserved to a small sliver of the whole newspaper. The article is located by a Ringling Circus Elephant Trainer death, and not front page news. \n\nTo find this article, I typed in the keyword Stephen Wise under Newspapers.com and narrowed my search to the dates provided on History Unfolded.",
                "CM Comments": "Hello Jonathan, thank you for your contribution to History Unfolded! \nYour article has been approved. Please note, you're right to point out the article was positioned far from the front page, but its title is actually prominently displayed on p.4: \"State Department Believed to Have Proof of Murders\" is the sub-headline; the main headline is in bigger characters above that : \"U. S. Jewish Group Hears Details of Polish Slaughter Today\" \u2013 I edited your data for you (the circus elephant photo right next to it is indeed awkward!) \nGood job adding the author, I also added the news service he was working with, mentioned at the beginning of the paragraph: Kenneth L. Dixon (AP). Keep up the great work, we look forward to other interesting finds from you. \u2013Nadia",

Also, you may have noticed mentions of \"ONA\" and \"Overseas News Agency\" at the beginning of the article: ONA is a wire service, and this information should be entered in the Author/Byline field. \nThanks again, looking forward to other submissions from you! \u2013Nadia",

The article details the ways in which Nazi's were gathering large groups of Jews and mass murdering them in areas such as Poland.  This is important during this time period because it finally gives North Americans a solid depiction of the horror occurring in Germany, which may have led to the Americans assisting in the eventual end of the Holocaust.",

I feel this article is relevant because it gives an idea as to how little the American people cared about foreign affairs.\n\nCommunity Manager Comment: Article can be found here:\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/clip/15277653/jewish_organizations_will_study_nazi/",

Of course, it raises the question of whether it is more prominent to be on bottom of the front page or top of the second or third page. Also, though it is at the bottom of the page, the headline is in ALL CAPS. While a specific author is credited, he clearly crafted the article using the AP wire service content (which is also credited). Perhaps that had an impact on placement.\n\nRegardless, thanks for the great find, and thanks for joining us in this research!\n\n/David",

Exterminations camps are not listed as one of the methods used in the mass murders;  Killing methods are depicted in a few different ways, including doctors injecting air bubbles into veins: \"One Nazi physician can handle more than 100 men an hour by this method.\"  Another method of extermination listed:  \"battalions commanded by elite SS troops were reported to have dragged victims from their homes or seized them on the streets of Polish towns.  Elderly Jews and cripples were carted directly to cemeteries and shot.\"  This article also says Hitler is offering 50 reichsmarks for each corpse which is then processed into commodities like soap.  \n\nWhile I would expected a confirmation that 2,000,000 people have been murdered in an effort to eliminate a culture, such news is not on the front page of the paper.",

                "User Comments": "Note: This article addresses one of History Unfolded's main areas of inquiry: how newspaper coverage influenced what Americans knew about the Holocaust, when they knew it, how they reacted to it, and what impacts this information had.  In the present article these concepts are not abstractions, but for one man concrete matters of life or death.\n\nThis article represents the afternoon paper the Brooklyn Eagle's [2] coverage of Dr. Stephen Wise's November 24, 1942 press conference [1] on the Nazi plan to exterminate the Jews (the November 24, 25, 26, and 27 papers were checked).  There was coverage related to the extermination of Jews in Europe on two of these days,[3][4] but no coverage of Dr. Wise's press conference other than the present article.\n\nThe present article reports that earlier on the day it was published, Wednesday, November 25, 1942, 60-year-old Jewish furrier Volco Zissman committed suicide by, it was believed, jumping from his former 15th-floor apartment.  His body was found \"in front of Standish Hall, 45 W. 81st St., Manhattan.\"\n\nIt goes on to explain that when Zissman came to the U.S. \"he had to leave his wife in France.\"  It further explains that on a dresser in Zissman's former apartment, from which he plunged, were found a note written in French \"and a newspaper opened to a statement of Rabbi Stephen S. Wise\" that the killing of all occupied Europe's Jews had been ordered by Hitler.\n\nThe article leaves it to the reader to put together these facts and come to the conclusion that Zissman may have committed suicide due to feelings about his wife remaining in France to possibly perish under Hitler's mass murder order reported in the newspaper left open on the dresser.\n\nThis article is a remarkable example of the impact that newspaper coverage can have on people in general and specifically the impact coverage of Rabbi Wise's press conference on the Holocaust seems to have had on Mr. Zissman.\n\nWhat article could have triggered Mr. Zissman's suicide?  We know that it had to be somewhere inside the newspaper since the present article says that the newspaper containing the article was \"opened,\" which would have been unnecessary if the article were on the front or back page.\n\nThe New York Times, believed to be a morning newspaper that Mr. Zissman would have had access to in Manhattan, had an article on Rabbi Wise's press conference, published on November 25, 1942, that mentioned Hitler's \"extermination campaign\" on \"Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe.\"[5]  This New York Times article was on page 10, inside the paper, so it is a candidate for the article that may have triggered Mr. Zissman's suicide.  Perhaps amplifying the shock of this first New York Times article were two other related articles also on page 10. [6][7]\n\nIt seems unlikely that the Brooklyn Eagle could be the source of the suicide-triggering article.  This is because this newspaper did not publish any articles about Dr. Wise's speech except the present one (see above).  Note that [3] does not mention Wise and was published on the front page, making it a poor candidate for the article that spurred Mr. Zissman to suicide.\n\nOf course other articles including those in morning newspapers published on November 25th and in afternoon papers published on November 24th with the correct coverage published inside the paper are candidates too.\n\n----------References and Notes----------\n\n[1] For example see: https://newspapers.ushmm.org/article/8328\n\n \"Corpses Priced at 50 Marks, Nazis Use Them to Make Soap; The Whitewright Sun | November 26, 1942 | Texas; Archive Location: https://www.newspapers.com; Page: 1.\"\n\n[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Eagle\n\n[3] https://newspapers.ushmm.org/article/5975\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/clip/9545998/the_brooklyn_daily_eagle/\n\n\"Himmler Orders 50% of Jews Executed by Dec. 21, Poles Say; Brooklyn Eagle; Brooklyn, New York; November 24, 1942; Byline: UP - Page: 1.\"\n\n[4] https://newspapers.ushmm.org/article/8391\n\n\"Call on Jews to Avenge Systematic Nazi Killings; Brooklyn Eagle | November 26, 1942 | New York; Archive Location: https://www.newspapers.com; Page: 3.\"\n\n[5] WISE GETS CONFIRMATIONS; Checks With State Department on Nazis' 'Extermination Campaign'; The New York Times; BYLINE: AP; PUBLISH DATE: November 25, 1942; PAGE NUMBER: 10.\nhttps://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1942/11/25/85060900.html?pageNumber=10\n\n[6] HIMMLER PROGRAM KILLS POLISH JEWS; Slaughter of 250,000 in Plan to Wipe Out Half in Country This Year Is Reported REGIME IN LONDON ACTS Officials of Poland Publish Data \u2014 Dr. Wise Gets Check Here by State Department; The New York Times; BYLINE: By JAMES MacDONALD Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES; PUBLISH DATE: November 25, 1942;  PAGE NUMBER: 10.\nhttps://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1942/11/25/85060896.html?pageNumber=10\n\n[7] Details Reaching Palestine; The New York Times; BYLINE: Wireless to THE NEW YORK TIMES; PUBLISH DATE: November 25, 1942; PAGE NUMBER: 10.\nhttps://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1942/11/25/85061308.html?pageNumber=10",

                "User Comments": "A version of this article also appeared in the Dallas Morning News (https://newspapers.ushmm.org/article/2604).  Due to the present article's historical significance, the associated comments below are somewhat lengthy as this article contains much to annotate.\n\nThis article reports on information about atrocities against Jews in Europe by Nazi Germany told by sources to Dr. Stephen S. Wise, World Jewish Congress chairman and American Jewish Congress president, and confirmed \"as authentic by the\" State Department.  The article states that Dr. Wise had a \"press conference shortly after he had conferred with State Department officials.\"\n\n----------Research Into the Accuracy of Dr. Wise's Information----------\n\nOne piece of information communicated to Dr. Wise was that about 2,000,000/4,000,000 Jews in the parts of Europe occupied by the Nazis had been killed.  Another two pieces of information were that (A) in 1942 Hitler ordered the extermination of all of the Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe and (B) that the Nazis were processing the bodies of deceased civilians into \"such war-vital commodities as soap, fats, and fertilizer.\"\n\nIn regards to the information of (A) above, Hitler authorized the extermination of the Jews in 1941 but the January 20, 1942 Wansee Conference was where the implementation of this plan was discussed [0], so Dr. Wise received reasonably accurate information about Hitler's orders to exterminate the Jews and their implementation.\n\nAs to the information of (B), processing of human corpses by Nazis into soap, fats, and fertilizer, the first (soap) seems to have only occurred on a small scale despite rumors to the contrary [1] while there are numerous reports of concentration camp crematorium ashes and/or bones being used for fertilizer, for example in Majdanek [2][5], Birkenau [3], Dachau [7], Neuengamme [5],  Janowska [6], Buchenwald [4][7], and to hide the evidence of crimes [8].\n\nAccordingly, the information Dr. Wise received about the soap production from human corpses seems to be based on rumors circulating at the time and greatly exaggerated while the information on processing of bodies of civilians into fertilizer seems to have significant accuracy.\n\n----------Nazi Reaction----------\n\nThe news reported in the present article was published in at least two New York Times articles on November 25, 1942 [10] and November 26, 1942 [11].  In [11] appears a statement that documents from the State Department contained affidavits attributed to \"reliable persons who knew\" of atrocities including producing soap (and also lubricants and fats) from Jewish corpses.\n\n(As a research note, if it hasn't been already done, it would be interesting to find the State Department documents mentioned above to see what the sources of the different pieces of information were and if they add anything to the historical record.)\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, the news contained in these New York Times reports reached Heinrich Himmler, Reich Leader of the SS and the \"key and senior Nazi official responsible for conceiving and overseeing implementation of the so-called Final Solution, the Nazi plan to murder the Jews of Europe.\" [13]\n\nIn response to this news, Himmler on November 30, 1942 wrote a letter to Heinrich Muller, chief of the Gestapo and one of the planners and executors of the Holocaust, [14] which reportedly said in part,\n\n\"You have guaranteed me that at every site the corpses of these deceased Jews are either burned or buried, and that at no site anything else can happen with the corpses\"\n\nElsewhere in the letter Himmler asks Muller to investigate if \"misuse\" of this policy had occurred, \"misuse\" that can be interpreted to possibly refer to Wise's allegations of soap, lubricant and fat making from Jewish corpses. [15]\n\nThis letter has been interpreted to support the notion that in order to enhance the secrecy of the murders of Jews in death camps there was no widespread and industrial production of soap, lubricants, and fats from Jewish corpses.\n\nThere is a reported discrepancy in this letter that should be addressed.  The letter refers to Wise's point of view as of September, 1942, a time before he had spoken publicly of these issues.  This discrepancy has been explained as either a mistake in the letter or due to an intelligence interception in September, 1942 of the information that was ultimately communicated to Dr. Wise.  The latter is a viable possibility because the Nazis had cracked a diplomatic code in Switzerland, the source of this information. [15]\n\n----------References and Notes----------\n\n[0] Wannsee Conference and the \"Final Solution;\" https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005477\n\n[1] See the discussion in the following History Unfolded submission: https://newspapers.ushmm.org/article/8325\n\nUltimate Atrocity-Nazis Manufactured Soap From Bodies of Humans; The Pittsburgh Press | July 10, 1945 | Pennsylvania; Archive Location: https://www.newspapers.com; Page: 6.\n\nAdditionally, two items from the USHMM collections relevant to this issue are:\n\nA) (Accession Number: 1994.55.6)https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/irn8728\nThis first item is a bar of soap \"issued to Edmund Graf while imprisoned at Flossenburg.\"  The description of this item goes on to state that \"he was told that it had been made from the 'remains of Jewish victims,' but this rumor was not true.\"  Note that this soap is stamped \"RIF\"\n\nB) (Photograph #48966) https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/pa1168095\nThis second item is a photo captioned, \"Jewish men in the Hallen displaced persons camp bury bars of soap believed to be made from human fat.\"  The original caption written in Yiddish says, \"Bringing for burial the remains of our martyrs--several boxes of RIF soap -- (pure Jewish fat).\"  Note that the bar of soap of A) is \"RIF\" soap also.\n\nA Wikipedia article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_made_from_human_corpses) explains the significance of the \"RIF\" stamp on German soap and starts by mentioning that in Germany during the War there was a fat shortage.  Briefly, this article explains that \"RIF\" means \"National Center for Industrial Fat Provisioning\" and not \"State Jewish Fat,\" the latter which would have the acronym \"RJF\" and could be confused with \"RIF\" due to fonts used at the time.  That \"RIF\" soap was made from Jewish fat was a rumor used to terrify Jews and others to coerce compliance with the Nazi regime [9] but generally accepted to be false.  Items A) and B) above provide examples of how this rumor was spread in concentration camps and its penetration and acceptance at the time.\n\nC) A third item worth mentioning is \"Sam Waagenaar articles\" ( https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/irn514209 ) Accession Number: 1993.A.0098, including one article about \" his experiences with what he believed to be a human soap factory.\"  It would be interesting to see if this article refers to Dr. Spanners lab in Danzig, Poland or the soap production facility at the Jasenovac concentration camp or a third less well known facility where production of soap from human corpses may have occurred ([1] above for more information on Dr. Spanner and Jasenovac).\n\n[2] GERMANS TELL OF ATROCITIES AT MAJDANEK; Lead Daily Call | August 30, 1944 | South Dakota; Archive Location: https://www.newspapers.com; Page: 1, Continued on Page 3.\nhttps://newspapers.ushmm.org/article/8327\nThis article states that at Majdanek crematorium oven ashes were mixed with manure and used to fertilize cabbage patches.\n\n[3] U.S. Verifies Nazi Murder Of Millions; Newspaper: Oakland Tribune; Publication Date: November 26, 1944; Page: A1, A15.\nhttps://newspapers.ushmm.org/article/1154\nThis article states that at Birkenau crematorium oven ashes were used as fertilizer at the Hermense labor camp.\n\n[4] Eyewitness of the War \"I Saw-\" GERMAN CREMATORIUM; Newspaper: The Minneapolis Morning Tribune; Publication Date: May 24, 1945; Page: 2.\nhttps://newspapers.ushmm.org/article/8122\nThis article states that Buchenwald crematorium oven ashes were converted into fertilizer for the fields.\n\n[5] Encyclopedia of Cremation; 1 Edition, December 28, 2005; Edited by Douglas J.

                "User Comments": "Through the Google News archives I found this Sarasota Herald-Tribune edition by searching the key word \u201cJews\u201d. I scrolled through a few pages and found the headline \u201cHitler Regime Wipes Out Jews by Mass Murder\u201d. This edition was published the day before Thanksgiving 1942. With the holiday season quickly approaching, a quarter of the paper is covered in advertisements for holiday radio shows, Thanksgiving menus, food advertisements, and even a picture of children on Mrs. Claus\u2019 lap appear throughout eight pages. The two main headlines include: \u201cNazis Lose 100,000 Men at Stalingrad\u201d and a photo with the title \u201cU.S. Warship Rescues Jap Flier\u201d. These two headlines portray the United States as winning the war against the Axis powers and coincide with the warm feelings that families want to have as they enter the holiday seasons. \nThe majority of the pages that follow the front page are advertisements, cartoons, a listing of social activities, and local news such as a campaign advertisement for city council. As this is a local newspaper published for Sarasota residents, discusses how locals are affected by the war efforts including shortages of oil and milk. \n\tThe headline \u201cNazi Plan for Wiping out Jews to be Outlined\u201d is found sandwiched between a photo of a baby wearing only a smile and a t-shirt that exposes his bum, followed by a caption bringing humor to the story about a diaper shortage in Memphis, Tennessee and is situated next to a large advertisement posting for a vacuum cleaner, including steps on how to use and maintain the cleaner. Notice how the advertisement is about twice the size of the Nazi plan posting. It is ironic, or extremely purposeful by the hands of the editor, to conceal the article about state officials and President Roosevelt confirming that 2 million Jews have already been slaughtered at the hands of Hitler. In addition, the article informs readers that Dr. Stephen S. Wise, chairman of the World Jewish Congress and president of the American Jewish Congress, has documentation proving that Hitler ordered the extermination of all Jews in Nazi-ruled Europe by the end of 1942 (nearly one month after this publication). Dr. Wise further outlines Hitler\u2019s plan saying \u201cNazis were moving some four-fifths of the Hews in Hitler-ruled European countries to Poland\u201d. He also details the method of execution by injections that can kill 100 people each hour. This publication is cut short with more alarming information that the Jewish population in Warsaw had been reduced from 500,000 to an estimated 100,000. One could easily miss this very detailed and horrific article amid all the holiday cheer and light-hearted advertisements. While it is significant to show the loss of 100,000 Nazis in bold, large font on the front page, the sheer number of Jews killed and the further genocides discussed in the Nazi Plan headline overcome the story of the 100,000 Nazis killed. The holiday season is a time of chaos, stress and busyness, but it is also a time of reflection, family time and joy. To go into the season with the thought of Jews being murdered at alarming rates is not enjoyable conversation for the Thanksgiving table. I imagine a family would rather enjoy discussing local solutions to shortages, how to help troops through the holiday season, and the recent Nazi loss at Stalingrad. I understand the editor\u2019s logic in making the final call on headlines, but wonder if newspaper's focus had been more on the Jewish genocide, if the public would have pushed for more action from the Allied Powers to stop the Holocaust sooner.\n(1942, November 25).
