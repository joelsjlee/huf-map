Thank you for pointing out the typo in the sub-headline. Per our convention, I added “[sic]” after “Htiler”,  to show the error isn't ours but the paper’s. Interestingly, as you may have noticed, there’s another typo in one of the paragraph headers below, “Slaughter of Polls” instead of “Poles”.  \nWe hope you’ll get to contribute to History Unfolded again! –Nadia",

      "CM Comments": "Hello Christopher, this is a great new addition to the collection, thank you! It’s a bit tricky, but considering the date and the content, it’s a better fit for our “Allies Denounce” event, rather than “Nazi Plan to Kill All Jews Confirmed”, although I see why you selected that module. You can read a description here: https://newspapers.ushmm.org/events/allies-denounce-nazi-plan-to-exterminate-the-jews. \nYou make a good point about the page where the piece is featured; I’d say page 4 is actually not that bad as this is the editorial page, so I think it means the paper actually picked these specific news to comment on. I changed your Article Type from News Article to Editorial/Opinion Piece, again due to the placement on this page, under the paper’s information, even though the tone is pretty neutral. I also removed “Daily wire / AP”, as I believe this applies to the paper in general rather than the editorials in particular. Let us know if you have questions, thank you for your good work!",

While it is a few days before the Allies officially denounced and this article only mentions FDR's response, I believe this article is more about the response rather than the actual announcement of the Nazis' plan.

      "User Comments": "The whole world had known that the Nazi's were committing atrocities on the Jewish race in their occupied territory. However, Dr. Stephen Wise - President of the American Jewish Congress - gave a very famous press conference in which he brought to the surface the actual activities of mass murder on an industrial scale that was being carried out. His estimation that since 1939 2,000,000 million jews had been deported or murdered, and that an additional 5,000,000 more jews were in danger of death shocked the world. This article testifies to that effect.",

      "CM Comments": "Hello Trevor, thank you for your contribution to History Unfolded! This is a great article for our \"Nazi Plan\" event module, but please note we already have it in the database. One way to avoid duplicates is to go to Menu > Explore User Research on our website before submitting; you can do a headline search, or use the Newspaper and Event filters to see what's there and make sure you're the first user to upload your find.     \n\n It looks like you took a photo of the screen? For a better resolution image, we recommend you get a PDF of the page: on the Library of Congress's Chronicling America website, you have a Text, PDF, and jpeg option on each newspaper page, so that you should be able to easily upload the PDF to History Unfolded.    \n\nAlso make sure you get the page number directly from the newspaper: here the website says it's p.11, but it's actually page \"A–9\", so I entered A9 in your Page field (for some reason the website listed three \"page 2\"!). In any case, as you pointed out, the placement on the page – and in the paper – is interesting.   \nKeep up the good work, Trevor, we look forward to your next finds! –Nadia",

I didn't find anything on the front page for the Trenton Evening Times for the Allied Denunciation of the Holocaust for the day it happened or the day after, but I will keep looking, I just thought it was strange that the possible rise in the price of milk had better real estate in the paper than a high profile announcement from the state department.",

This is indeed an editorial; the first hint is that this page, with the newspaper info on the top left center, is typically where opinion pieces are featured. Then there's the content of the piece of course, as you noticed. \nYou're the first user to submit to our \"Allies Denounce Nazi Plan\" from the Trenton Evening Times, it would be great if you could pursue your research. \nLooking forward to your next interesting finds. –Nadia",

It's interesting to me that the Democrat and Chronicle spells that out the audience was in Albany, while the Ithaca paper doesn't make that explicitly clear. I have been curious whether papers regularly truncated AP stories or modified them.  Fascinating. I can't wait for scholars and members of the public to do this comparative analysis when we have a larger data set and transition to phase II of the project. I think that's all your latest entries, Sandi. Superb work as always! -Eric",

I changed the event module to Allies Denounce Nazi Plan to “Exterminate” the Jews\" because the article mentions the Allied condemnation of the Final Solution and because of the newspaper issue date. Great work! -Eric",

It looks that this is a spot-on relevant article. I can't yet approve it though, since I need to be able to see on the attached image the newspaper name, issue date, and page number. Is it possible in the future to send us full-page scans of the page? For this entry, can you email the full-page to me? Then, we can approve this as our first student submission article from Wyoming. -Eric\n\n[Eric approved on July 10, 2019 because more recently approved article https://newspapers.ushmm.org/article/12449 verifies the metadata.]",

It discusses the camps that have been created in Poland, as well as the death camps and that the victims are being worked to death. \nThe author reports the facts and does not personally state his opinion, but it is obvious that the paper was written from the perspective of someone against Nazi ideology and on the side of the Allies, who condemn the murders.

Other United Nations are expected to subscribe to it later.\nThe denunciation supplemented a previous pledge by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill to punish Axis officials guilty of killing hostages and other offenses.\nThe statement of Jewish oppression accused Germany of “carrying into effect Hitler’s oft-repeated intention to exterminate the Jewish people in Europe.” It charged that Jews were being transported from occupied countries “in conditions of appalling horror and brutality;” that Polish ghettos are being “sys-\n(Turn to page 12)\n\nUnited Nations Condemn Nazi Slaying of Jews\n(From page 1)\ntematically emptied;” that the able-bodied are being worked to death in labor camps, and that the inform [sic] are left to die or are massacred.\nThe text of the statement, made public here and in London:\n“The attention of the Belgian, Czechoslovak, Greek, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norwegian, Polish, Soviet, United Kingdom, United States and Yugoslav governments and the French National Committee has been drawn to numerous reports from Europe that the German authorities, not content with denying to persons of Jewish race in all the territories over which their barbarous rule has been extended, the most elementary human rights, are now carrying into effect Hitler’s oft-repeated intention to exterminate the Jewish people in Europe.\nMany Are Transported\n“From all the occupied countries Jews are being transported in conditions of appalling horror and brutality to Eastern Europe.\n“In Poland, which has been made the principal Nazi slaughter house, the ghettos established by the invader are being systematically emptied of all Jews except for a few highly-skilled workers required for war industries. None of those taken away are ever heard of again.\n“The ablebodied are slowly worked to death in labor camps. The inform [sic] are left to die of exposure and starvation or are deliberately massacred in mass executions. The number of victims of these bloody cruelties is reckoned in many hundreds of thousands of entirely innocent men, women and children.\n“The above mentioned governments and the French National Committee condemn in the strongest possible terms this bestial policy of cold-blooded extermination. They declare that such events can only strengthen the resolve of all freedom loving people to overthrow the barbarous Hitlerite tyranny. They re-affirm their solemn resolution to ensure that those responsible for these crimes shall not escape retribution and to press on with the necessary practical measures to this end.”",

      "CM Comments": "Indeed Leeah, this does appear before the official joint declaration. Public recognition of this plan was a process that began with a report to the State Department in August. It took them three months to confirm the information and several weeks more to issue the declaration. In the meantime, a report was sent to the Allies by the Polish government (in exile). That is the context for this article. Thanks for your contribution. -Edie",

Another convention we have adopted is that for the byline, put the letter abbreviation without punctuation. So, AP instead of A.P. I know we aren't very clear on the front-end of the website about our requested standardization, so I apologize in advance for that. \n\nI changed the event module to: Allies Denounce Nazi Plan to “Exterminate” the Jews because of the date of this article and the specific reference that: \"Allied governments recently protested against crimes against the Jews and warned that those responsible would be punished\". I see the reference to the rounding up of Jews in Paris later on in the article, but the issue date still makes me inclined to change the event. -Eric",

      "User Comments": "This 66 page Sunday edition of the St. Petersburg Times reflects the time of its publication: Christmas 1942. Christmas advertisements flood these pages announcing sales for: clothing, furniture, and fruit baskets at nearby department stores- perfect gifts for your loved ones. Approximately 27 of the 66 pages (40 percent) are filled with cartoons, wedding announcements, classifieds and other assortments of light heartedness. The main headline is attention grabbing, stating in capital letters “REDS LAUNCH NEW DRIVE” followed by “Allies shatter Jap Line; Enemy Cruiser is Sunk”. The overall tone of this edition is hope set in reality. It does not stray from the difficulties of war, such as its mention of food rations, and the need for 59 draftees, but it counteracts these realities by showing local acts of heroism, and courage. One such example is the story of Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker, who survived 21 days in an open boat in the Pacific and has his picture featured prominently in the paper. Rickenbacker tries to down play the hardship of rationing food compared to being stranded in the Pacific.\n\tThe byline entitled “Hitler Regime Wipes Out Jews by Mass Murder” is found on page 10 of 66.  It is found on the top of the page, mid-center, under a page entitled National News. To the left of the article is a byline describing the death of a character from a New Jersey murder trial, and on the right hand side is a photo showing the Army taking over a junkyard in South Carolina. A large advertisment is found on this page selling “practical gifts” for Christmas including many household items. This article is different in its layout, it breaks down Hitler’s impact on the Jews country by country, mentioning: Poland, Yugo-Slavia, Czecho-Slovakia, France, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Norway. This breakdown shows the Hitler Regime’s sphere of influence and the imprisonment, ghetto formations and annihilation of European Jews. The article has a heavy emphasis on country geography and the cities impacted. Depending on the reader’s prior knowledge, this may be a stumbling block in the reader’s understanding of the article’s depth. However, this article also uses statistics to underscore the relevance and importance of realizing how Hitler’s Regime has changed Europe. The article quotes Dr. Stephen S. Wise, president of the American Jewish Congress, stating that “since 1932 2,000,000 Jews in Europe have been deported or have perished, and ‘another 5,000,000 are in danger of extermination”. These parcels of information from Dr. Wise were also reported in the November 25, 1942 edition of the Sarasota-Herald Tribune. \n\tAs Dr. Wise’s findings were found in two Florida papers published within one month in of each other, I decided to explore this connection, and see if other papers published Dr. Wise’s statistics. After using Google to search parts of the quote “since 1939 2,000,000 Jews in Europe have been deported or have perished…” I found that five national papers published Dr. Wise’s findings, including papers in: Ohio, Kansas, California and Arizona. After no success finding these publications (on microfilm) in better known newspapers such as The New York Times and Wall Street Journal, I used Google again to search for: “Hitler Regime Wipes Out Jews by Mass Murder” Sarasota Herald-Tribune. The first link led me to the History Unfolded website, which is part of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. From there, I found that on November 24, 1942, Dr. Wise held a press conference to discuss his findings of the genocide of Jews, and persuaded President Roosevelt to take action against these annihilations. From this press conference, the Polish government sent a report two weeks later entitled “The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied Poland” to the government leaders of the Allied Forces. The publication of this St Petersburg Times article correlates with the time that the Allied governments, who were part of the United Nations, denounced the Nazi’s plan of mass extermination, which took place on December 17, 1942 (Nazi Plan to Kill All Jews Confirmed). \n\tI found this article through the Google News archive with the keyword “Jews”; I did not know the significance of this date and its correlations with Dr. Wise’s press conference. It is interesting that lesser known newspapers such as The Times Recorder from Zanesville Ohio published about it while a larger circulation audience such as The New York Times did not. So from 1942-1945, Allied governments and citizens knew about Hitler’s plan and while The Allies did eventually defeat the Nazi Regime, to what length and what expenses did the Allies go to make sure no more Jews die? They knew how, they knew where, and they knew approximately how many- did they just seemingly allowed it to happen? Millions could have been saved if the Allies came together and made a plan to combat this genocide, I am not inferring it would be easy, but I am implying that the Allies knew Jews were being murdered and they did not do enough to stop it. \nNazi plan to kill all Jews confirmed. https://newspapers.ushmm.org/events/nazi-plan-to-kill-all-jews-confirmed\n\nLink to article: https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JRVPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=hk0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=7097%2C6474709",

We were taken to the third floor Special Collections area, where the microfilm and microfilm machines were located.  We located the December 1942 microfilm as instructed on the website.  We were given one of the newer microfilm machines, where you could zoom in and crop out the images better.  We went to the front page of the Thursday, December 17, 1942 Akron Beacon Journal News microfilm and almost instantly found our article.  It was a small, three paragraph article titled, 11 Allies Pledge Revenge for Jews.  After printing it out, we continued through the month finding nothing more.\n\nOur article stated:\t  \n\nA conference of eleven allied nations including the French national committee condemned the Nazi plan to exterminate the Jews and promised retribution.  Some of the nations included but were not limited to Belgium, Poland, the United States of America, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.  While only 12 countries signed the pledge, more were expected to sign on.  This pledge was added to an earlier pledge by Prime Minister Winston  Churchill and President Franklin Roosevelt, which stated that they would punish individuals guilty of killing hostages among other offenses.",

      "User Comments": "I was surprised to find out that the Allies were aware in December 1942 that the Germans were \"carrying into effect Hitler's oft-repeated intentions to exterminate the Jewish people in Europe.\" Moreover, the Allies had specific indications that Poland was a \"slaughter house\"  of Jews from ghettoes. This article challenges my assumption that the Allies were relatively oblivious of the specific atrocities of the Holocaust. I also wonder based on the reading of this article what the Allies did in their pledge that those responsible \"shall not escape retribution.\" If the Allies were slow to act, that would be an uncomfortable realization for me.",
